## Executive Summary

Mr.Market's execution engine is a **multi-tenant, tick-driven, intent-based pooled executor** system. It correctly solves multi-user order pooling — something Hummingbot (single-user, single-strategy) has no equivalent for. However, the executor boundary was scoped at `(exchange, pair)` rather than allowing multi-leg coordination, which blocks cross-venue strategies like XEMM and Spot-Perpetual Arbitrage.

**Total gaps identified: 84** across 4 tiers.

| Tier | Count | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1: Foundation | 12 | Multi-leg executor, derivative connector, event bus, order state machine, user streams, trading rules, time sync, connector internals |
| Tier 2: Strategies | 25 | XEMM, Perp MM, Spot-Perp Arb, AMM Arb, Avellaneda, proposal pipeline, PMM micro-features, arb specifics |
| Tier 3: Executors + DeFi + Fees | 13 | Triple barrier, DCA, Grid, TWAP, CLMM LP, Gateway middleware, fee system depth |
| Tier 4: Operations + Infra | 34 | Backtesting, trade recorder, PnL reporting, notifications, remote control, order book depth, deployment |

## Architectural Comparison

### Hummingbot: Strategy Owns Multiple Connectors

```
Clock (1s tick)
  ├── ConnectorBase (Binance Spot)    ─┐
  ├── ConnectorBase (Binance Perp)    ─┤── Strategy holds REFERENCES to both
  └── Strategy                        ─┘   via MarketTradingPairTuple
```

- **`MarketTradingPairTuple`** = `(connector_instance, pair, base, quote)` — a strategy can hold N of these, each pointing to a different exchange/instrument.
- **`buy_with_specific_market(tuple)`** — the strategy directs each order to a specific connector by reference.
- **Event bus per connector** — a single strategy subscribes to fill events from ALL its connectors simultaneously via `c_add_markets()`.
- **`DerivativeBase`** extends `ExchangeBase` with `set_leverage()`, `set_position_mode()`, `get_funding_info()` — spot and perp share the same `buy()/sell()` interface.

### Mr.Market: Executor Owns One Exchange-Pair

```
ClockTick
  └── ExecutorRegistry
        └── ExchangePairExecutor("binance", "BTC/USDT")  ← single venue
              └── sessions[]  ← strategies sharing this one venue
```

### Key Differences

| Dimension | Hummingbot | Mr.Market |
|---|---|---|
| **Addressing unit** | `MarketTradingPairTuple(connector, pair)` — strategy holds N | `ExchangePairExecutor(exchange, pair)` — one per executor |
| **Order routing** | `buy_with_specific_market(tuple)` — targets any connector | `StrategyOrderIntent.exchange` — single exchange field |
| **Fill events** | Strategy subscribes to ALL connectors' events via pub/sub | Executor dispatches fills only within its own `(exchange, pair)` |
| **Cross-leg coordination** | Strategy-level: `did_fill_order()` → hedge on other connector | None — no concept of linked legs |
| **Instrument types** | `ExchangeBase` (spot) vs `DerivativeBase` (perp) with shared interface | No spot/perp distinction |
| **State machine** | XEMM: hedging-in-flight gate; Spot-Perp: `Closed→Opening→Opened→Closing` | No multi-leg state machine |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Single-user per bot instance | Multi-user pooling per `(exchange, pair)` ✅ |

### Design Tradeoff (Not a Mistake)

The two systems optimized for different things:

- **Hummingbot** = single-user, single-strategy instance. Multi-venue is easy because nothing is shared.
- **Mr.Market** = multi-tenant, multi-order. The `ExchangePairExecutor` pools multiple users' orders on the same `(exchange, pair)` to share market data, tick cycles, and connections.

The engine correctly solved multi-tenancy but scoped the executor boundary too narrowly. The two capabilities aren't mutually exclusive — a `MultiLegExecutor` can coordinate across venues while pooling market data per-venue underneath.

## Gap Analysis

### Tier 1: Foundation

> These primitives unblock everything else. Without them, multi-venue strategies cannot be built.

#### #1 — Multi-Leg Executor

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `MarketTradingPairTuple` + `buy_with_specific_market()` — strategy holds N venue references |
| **What to Build** | A `MultiLegExecutor` that coordinates 2+ `(exchange, pair, instrumentType)` legs as one unit, with cross-leg event bridging (fill on leg A → action on leg B) |
| **Priority** | Critical |

#### #2 — Derivative Connector Interface

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `DerivativeBase` extending `ExchangeBase` with `set_leverage()`, `set_position_mode()`, `get_funding_info()`, `account_positions` |
| **What to Build** | Extend `ExchangeConnectorAdapterService` with a `DerivativeConnectorAdapter` wrapping CCXT's futures API — unified `buy()/sell()` but with position/margin/funding methods |
| **Priority** | Critical |

#### #3 — Cross-Connector Event Bus

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `StrategyBase.c_add_markets()` subscribing to N connectors' events simultaneously |
| **What to Build** | A `StrategyEventBus` where a strategy subscribes to fill/cancel/error events from multiple `(exchange, pair)` executors simultaneously |
| **Priority** | Critical |

#### #4 — Order Tracker with Cross-Connector Awareness

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `OrderTracker` keyed by `MarketTradingPairTuple` with shadow orders, in-flight cancel tracking |
| **What to Build** | Extend current intent store to track orders across multiple venues with `maker↔taker` linkage maps |
| **Priority** | Critical |

#### #19 — In-Flight Order State Machine

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `InFlightOrder` with states: `PENDING_CREATE → OPEN → PARTIALLY_FILLED → PENDING_CANCEL → CANCELED/FILLED/FAILED` |
| **Status** | We have `ExchangeOrderTracker` but no formal state machine per order — no partial fill tracking, no `PENDING_CANCEL` dedup |
| **Priority** | High |

#### #20 — User Stream Tracker (Private WebSocket)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `UserStreamTracker` — dedicated authenticated WebSocket per connector for fills, balance updates, position changes |
| **Status** | `PrivateStreamIngestionService` exists but is not per-connector or standardized as an interface |
| **Priority** | High |

#### #21 — Trading Rules / Quantization

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `TradingRule` per pair — min order size, price/qty step, min notional, enforced before order placement |
| **Status** | Not implemented — we rely on CCXT's defaults but don't enforce/validate pre-submission |
| **Priority** | High |

#### #22 — Time Synchronizer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `TimeSynchronizer` — corrects clock drift between bot and exchange server |
| **Status** | Missing — can cause order rejections on exchanges with strict timestamp validation |
| **Priority** | Medium |

#### #38 — Dual Update Mechanism (WS + REST Fallback)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | WebSocket for instant fills + REST polling every 10s as redundancy; `ClientOrderTracker` deduplicates |
| **Status** | We rely on one path only — no redundant reconciliation loop |
| **Priority** | High |

#### #39 — WebAssistantsFactory / Auth Abstraction

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | Per-exchange `AuthBase` (HMAC signing), `WebAssistantsFactory` producing configured REST + WS clients |
| **Status** | We use raw CCXT — no pluggable auth layer or standardized WS factory |
| **Priority** | Low (CCXT handles this) |

#### #40 — AsyncThrottler (Per-Endpoint Rate Limits)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | Each exchange endpoint has `RateLimit(weight, time_window)`, throttler auto-delays when approaching limits |
| **Status** | We have `withRateLimit` wrapper but it's global, not per-endpoint weighted |
| **Priority** | Medium |

#### #41 — Tracking State Persistence + Restoration

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `ConnectorBase.tracking_states` serializes in-flight orders; `restore_tracking_states()` rehydrates on restart |
| **Status** | Missing — in-flight order state is lost on server restart |
| **Priority** | High |

#### #42 — MarketsRecorder Event Subscription

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | Subscribes to ALL connector events, persists every `Order`, `TradeFill`, balance snapshot to SQLAlchemy/SQLite |
| **Status** | `StrategyExecutionHistory` only records strategy-level events, not raw connector-level fills |
| **Priority** | Medium |

| **Status** | CCXT supports it but our intent pipeline doesn't distinguish order types |
| **Priority** | High |

#### Arb & XEMM Specifics

#### #65 — Concurrent vs Sequential Order Submission

| | |
|---|---|

| **Priority** | High |

#### #66 — EVM/On-Chain Leg Prioritization

| **Hummingbot** | `OrderBookMessage` with `SNAPSHOT`, `DIFF`, `TRADE` types — separate queues for each stream; incremental diff application on top of snapshot |
| **Status** | We get full snapshots from CCXT — no incremental diff updates |
| **Priority** | Medium |

#### #77 — `get_quote_price()` vs `get_order_price()`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `quote_price` for profit calculation (may differ from execution price), `order_price` for actual submission — separates analysis from execution |
| **Status** | We use a single price for both |
| **Priority** | Medium |

#### #78 — Candles Feed / OHLCV Streaming

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `CandlesFactory` / `CandlesBase` — real-time candle feeds with configurable intervals, used by V2 controllers for indicator computation |
| **Status** | We fetch OHLCV on-demand but don't stream it |
| **Priority** | Medium |

#### #79 — Composite Order Book (Paper Trade)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `CompositeOrderBook` merges real exchange data with simulated order matching for paper trading |
| **Status** | Missing |
| **Priority** | Low |

#### Operational Features

#### #80 — Structured Logging with LogOption Flags

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | Per-strategy configurable log verbosity — `CREATE_ORDER`, `ADJUST_ORDER`, `MAKER_ORDER_FILLED`, `STATUS_REPORT` etc. can be toggled independently |
| **Status** | We log everything or nothing — no granular log control |
| **Priority** | Low |

#### #81 — `format_status()` with DataFrames

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | Every strategy produces structured status tables: active orders, inventory stats, PnL, spread analysis — accessible via `status` command |
| **Status** | Missing — no live strategy introspection |
| **Priority** | Medium |

#### #82 — Graceful Shutdown with Cancel-All

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | On stop: cancel all outstanding orders on all connectors, stop clock, stop recorder, clear references |
| **Status** | We stop strategies but don't guarantee all exchange orders are cancelled |
| **Priority** | High |

#### #83 — Docker Compose Multi-Service Deployment

| | |
|---|---|
| **Hummingbot** | `docker-compose.yml` with `hummingbot` + `gateway` services, volume mounts for `conf/`, `logs/`, `data/`, `scripts/` |
| **Status** | No containerized deployment story for the MM engine |
| **Priority** | Low |
